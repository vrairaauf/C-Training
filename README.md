## Introduction

This repository showcases my problem-solving skills by providing solutions to a variety of challenges from HackerRank. Each solution is implemented using the C programming language. The problems cover different difficulty levels and categories, including algorithms, data structures, and more.

## Solutions

Below is a list of the solved problems included in this repository:

- [Reverse diagonal](reverseDiagonal.c): Given a square matrix of size N x N, you need to reverse the diagonal elements of the matrix. The diagonal elements are the elements that run from the top left to the bottom right of the matrix. You are required to modify the matrix in-place to reverse the diagonal elements, without using any extra space.


Feel free to explore the solutions and study the code to understand the logic and approach used to solve each problem.

## Usage

To compile and run the C programs, follow these steps:

1. Install a C compiler such as GCC if you haven't already.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory of the desired problem solution.
4. Compile the C file using the command: `gcc -o output_file_name problem_name.c`
5. Run the compiled executable: `./output_file_name`

Please note that some solutions may require additional input files or command-line arguments, which will be mentioned within the specific problem's solution file.
